### üí° Idea
> Truth Dare & Stare is a Web Application where users can play the famous Truth Dare and Stare game with video and audio chat with their friends, can send stickers and many more....

### ü•Ö Goal
> Due to corona and lock down in many countries we are facing a serious mental health issues, specially the students who at this time enjoy the summer vacations with their friends are locked inside their houses. And the only thing we can do is to wait for the situation to improve. To contribute towards improving **mental health** I have made this game so that one can connect with their friends and enjoy, laugh and play with them(spending time with friends is the best way to bring smile).

### ü§î How To Play??
> Just create a room and share the code with your friends and ask them to join the room, no downloads or signup required!!!.<br/>Other rules and notes and be found once inside the room by clicking "How To Play" button in help section.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Tech Stack Used(MERN)
> 1. Front End: front end is made using **React** and **Material-UI** for designing components and **Framer Motion** for animation and **Twilio SDK** for video chat.
> 2. Back End: back end is REST based using **NodeJs** with **Express** and **MongoDB(mongoose)** for database. For logging **Log DNA** is used.
> 3. API'S: I have used **Twilio Programmable Video** and **DataTrack API**. Twilio Prorammable video is based on WebRTC and offers three type of rooms(actually four üôÑ) "go", "peer-to-peer", "group". Among them "go" rooms are free and allow 2 participants at max to connect to a room. Get more information about twilio programmable video [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/tutorials/basic-concepts).
> 4. Cloud Service: MongoDB Atlas for databse and heroku for hosting
